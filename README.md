# Ophthalmic Disease Screening

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ophthalmic Disease Screening project! This repository houses an advanced deep learning model developed for the automated screening of ophthalmic diseases using medical images. Our mission is to assist medical professionals in early detection and diagnosis, ultimately improving patient care and visual health outcomes.

## Model Overview

The Ophthalmic Disease Screening model is built on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, trained on a large dataset of annotated ophthalmic images. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, the model can accurately detect and classify various eye diseases, including but not limited to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, and cataracts.

## Takedown Notice

As of [Current Date], we have temporarily taken down the model for the purpose of research publication. This decision is essential to ensure the integrity and credibility of our research findings before making the model publicly available.

## Open Source Commitment

Our commitment to open-source principles is at the core of our mission. Once the research publication process is complete and our research findings have been shared with the public, we will open source the Ophthalmic Disease Screening model. By doing so, we hope to foster collaboration and enable researchers and developers worldwide to contribute, build upon our work, and create innovative solutions in the field of ophthalmic healthcare.

## Stay Informed

We understand your enthusiasm and interest in leveraging this technology for ophthalmic disease screening. To stay informed about the progress of our research publication and the expected timeline for the model's re-release, we encourage you to subscribe to our mailing list or follow our official channels.

## Contributions and Feedback

We deeply appreciate the valuable contributions and feedback from the medical and research communities throughout the development of this model. Your input has been instrumental in refining its accuracy and robustness. As we move forward with the research publication process, we welcome further engagement and collaboration with the community to continually improve and expand the capabilities of our screening model.

## Contact

Thank you for your understanding and support during this temporary takedown period. We are excited to share our research findings and make the Ophthalmic Disease Screening model open source in the near future.
